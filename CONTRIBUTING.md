# Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are very welcome. If you are using this package and fixed a bug for yourself, please consider submitting a PR! Also, you can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vitorebatista).

## Guidelines

If you are planning to submit a pull request, it's very important to follow these basic rules:

### Getting started

1. Fork the project on Github.
2. Clone the project from the fork you have created previously at first step.


Then, check out the project:

`$ git clone https://github.com/`**your-github-user**`/horoscopefree.git`

### If adding a new feature:

- Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
